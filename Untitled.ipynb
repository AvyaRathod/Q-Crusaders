      "same thing happened to me i just uninstalled it altogether because nothing would load\n",
      "like the way that it learns as it goes never felt completely comfortable with everything blocked in abp or ghostery since they rendered many sites in error or nonfunctional wasnt such a big deal for me but made it problematic for less experienced user privacy badger is easy to use for advanced users that want to block everything but still offers good protection and functionality to users who just prefer to browse\n",
      "note that yesterdays update has broken videos using both flash and html formats for many sites on the chrome browser disabling it on those sites or disabling the extension will fix the problem the firefox version did not have the effect of breaking these videos\n",

      "this application does the job it is designed to do very well i am always interested in seeing the absurd number of intrusions that it has blocked in certain websites my problem with it is that it seriously effects the working of a number of websites in particular many websites are unable to play or load videos while i am sure that some videos are problematic i dont believe as many as it is blocking are the problem is that when you look at the drop down box it is impossible to see which of the elements being blocked are privacy related and which are content related i am sure that this is somethign to do with the underlying content but it means that bar spending minutes every time i want to play a video i simply end up turning off its protection which defeats the point of having it in the first place however most of the time this works without having to think about it\n",
      "because its not an ad blocker its confusing for me too it works tho just not as an ad blocker\n",

      "its great at blocking scripts and other privacy invasive elements and does its job well that being said the new window popout every time you click to change what you allow and disallow is incredibly annoying theres no reason to have a popout like that every time as most sites dont require that to change extension settings a simple time delay on the new window popout would rectify this issue entirely\n",

      "same thing happened to me i just uninstalled it altogether because nothing would load\n",
      "like the way that it learns as it goes never felt completely comfortable with everything blocked in abp or ghostery since they rendered many sites in error or nonfunctional wasnt such a big deal for me but made it problematic for less experienced user privacy badger is easy to use for advanced users that want to block everything but still offers good protection and functionality to users who just prefer to browse\n",
      "note that yesterdays update has broken videos using both flash and html formats for many sites on the chrome browser disabling it on those sites or disabling the extension will fix the problem the firefox version did not have the effect of breaking these videos\n",

      "used to work really well but recently it has suffered regularly the extension will prevent the page from loading youll see a waiting for privacy badger message i assume its because its grabbing external scripts somewhere there really should be a fall back option so that if it times out the page can still load i keep having to disable it and am close to removing i still have hope though\n",

      "could you update your review please the bug was fixed promptly\n",
      "i love it a lot it does a great job behind the scenes and has the big plus of being governed by the eff there are rare occasions where i have to intervene once a month the intervention is most of the time simple move a slider in the popup it drastically improves my internet experience on a daily basis what could you want more\n",
      "does nothing for my computer i have not seen this application be able to block anything i tried it for a week and find it hard to believe that all the sites i visit are are tracker free and safe i uninstalled this addon today\n",

      "initially it seems pretty cool i used it for about six months if you read about this on some other professional reviews youll find something to the effect of its cool but breaks the internet experience and thats kinda true after you install this depending if you are a power user or facebook only internet user be prepared to spend minutes a day playing the recaptcha clicking on the picture games for literally every site you go to does that sound too bad well thats hours of year you are wasting with recaptcha because your user experience is indeed kinda broken some may say paying hours of your life away each year is a small price to pay for added privacy but i think you are getting by just fine using ublock everywhere and paying for adguard you have to weigh it yourself give it a try for sure but i think there are better options out there youll have a lot more time to live life without this horrible extension wasting your time\n",
      "i installed this and when i go to extensions i get a warning that says not from chrome web store even though i added it from chrome web store\n",
      "this application does the job it is designed to do very well i am always interested in seeing the absurd number of intrusions that it has blocked in certain websites my problem with it is that it seriously effects the working of a number of websites in particular many websites are unable to play or load videos while i am sure that some videos are problematic i dont believe as many as it is blocking are the problem is that when you look at the drop down box it is impossible to see which of the elements being blocked are privacy related and which are content related i am sure that this is somethign to do with the underlying content but it means that bar spending minutes every time i want to play a video i simply end up turning off its protection which defeats the point of having it in the first place however most of the time this works without having to think about it\n",
